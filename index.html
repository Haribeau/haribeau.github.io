            <h1>About Taniti</h1>
            <p>
                Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific.
                While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles,
                the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches,
                a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests,
                and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano.
                Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000.
                Until a recent increase in tourism,
                most of the Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.

                        In a surprising move, Taniti’s government has announced a new official

                        and the health of the population, promoting rest as essential
